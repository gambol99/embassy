		Notes: does the application have health checks? One thing i've noticed (and this could be a misconfiguration by me, but) is
		it can take a number of seconds to minutes for health checks to become active. While the health isn't yet active, the
		HealthCheckResult in the task json is missing, not false. So we can be in a situation where endpoints have been added, they haven't
		been checked yet, but the task health check status is missing.

			- check if the 'application' NOT just the task has a health check as its related to our service port
			- if yes, but the HealthCheckResult is missing or empty we have to assume the health check hasn't been added / processed yet.
			  Either way the endpoint hasn't been validated as 'passed' and so we must remove it from the active endpoints

		Extra Notes: As far as i'm aware there is no way to infer the port from the health check result, so we can't work out if the failed health
		is for our service port or another one. In way, it doesn't matter though, as Marathon will fail and restart a application if ANY of the
		health checks are in a failed state.
